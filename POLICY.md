* Entries must use *IPFS* (libp2p, ipld, multiformats is not enough)
* Entries must be immediately usable (eg. nothing that is paywall-only, even a free trial would be ok)
* Entries must have a clear license and/or privacy policy where applicable

This policy is evaluated by the site admins upon submission, per the process defined in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This policy was developed [here](https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs/issues/150) - please add questions, comments and suggestions there.
