* Entries must use *IPFS* (libp2p, ipld, multiformats is not enough)
* Entries must be **open-source** and contain a link to their source code.
* Entries must be immediately usable (eg. nothing that is paywall-only, even a free trial would be ok)
* Entries must have a clear license and/or privacy policy where applicable
